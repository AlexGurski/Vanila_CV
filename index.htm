                    My name is Alexander, I am 29 years old, born and living in Baranovichi in 2009.<br>
                    I started learning programming in 2009 when I entered he Baranovichi State High School of Light Industry. There I got basic knowledge in OOP and algorithms.
                    Then I was taken to the army, where my knowledge did not increase. At the end of my service life, there was a difficult economic situation in Belarus, there was no work, and I followed the simplest path - to stay in the army.
                    While studying at BarSU, I liked web development, my diploma was a Baranovichi coffee website working for a year.
                    Since the beginning of this year, I decided to make every effort to return to the roots and become a programmer. To do this, I teach react, JS. I also wrote several projects, a diploma for a friend on react, a personal portfolio website.
